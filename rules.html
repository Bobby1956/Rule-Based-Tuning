<h2><a name="Rules Heuristics for Tuning Chords"></a>Heuristics for Tuning Chords</h2>

<p>Although the following heuristics might possibly account for the majority of

chords encountered within a clearly defined key area, they are only the

beginning to a much broader picture of tonality. It is quite possible that every

chord the human auditory system is capable of identifying as a tonal entity can

be accounted for by recursively applying only a fairly limited number of such

rules.</p>
